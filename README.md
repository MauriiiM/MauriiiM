- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MauriiiM
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mobile development, especially cross-platform and specifically Flutter, but when it comes to native, my preference is iOS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my Flutter skills by learning new widly-used packages such as BLoC (I previously used Redux) and Freezed. In addition, I will be learning social network authentication/account creation.
- ðŸ“« Best way to reach me is probably through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/MauriiiM) or through an _outlook_ email with the _same_ name as my GitHub.
